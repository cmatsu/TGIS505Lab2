				<p>This is an interactive map that shows the locations of schools and McDonald's restaurants in Tacoma.<br><br>Clicking on a school reveals the location of the closest McDonald's to it, as well as display the distance between the school and the restaurant.</p>

				<h3>What is the purpose of this map?</h3>

				<p>Childhood obesity is a problem that is fueled by the abundance of cheap and accessible fast food options everywhere.<br><br>This map is aimed at helping concerned parents of students to understand where their child's school is located in relation to McDonald's restaurants, so as to determine the proximity of fast food for children and teens and subsequently predict the accessibility of it as well.<br><br>McDonald's was chosen as it is a store that is widespread and familiar to many children, considering the ways they market their food to a younger demographic by enticing them with kid-friendly meals and toys.</p>

				<h3>What can we observe?</h3>

				<p>It is evident that a majority of the restaurants are located in the central and southern regions of Tacoma, while the northeast and new Tacoma areas barely have any stores. Northeast Tacoma is home to some of Tacoma's wealthiest neighborhoods, so it is no surprise that there is a lack of McDonald's in the area.<br><br>There is potential here for further research to determine if children who attend schools in low-income neighborhoods are more suceptible to eating fast food, based on how much more abundant these stores are in these regions.</p>
